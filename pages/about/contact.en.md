**Email is the single preferred method of contact.**
Consult me via email if you need other contact methods.
Please note that I rarely use (neither has accounts for) IMs.

My personal email address is:

$$some\omicron{}ne\text{@}mear\!\dot{\iota}\!e_\bullet org$$

The following is also used:

$$kang.se\omicron{}nghoon\text{@}mear\!\dot{\iota}\!e_\bullet org$$

I'm able to receive from any email address ending with `@mearie.org`.
So feel free to send to `public`
if you are not able to read above TeX formulae for any reason.

My PGP public key is [`D4CB 40A2 65AA 1A25 0F90 5D29 8244 0FAB A670 9020`][key].
I personally do not use it a lot,
but you can use it to confidentially send an encrypted message.
